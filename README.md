COMP 20 Spring 2019 Private Repo for Craig Neubieser

1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? This repository is a good place to keep track of all my work from this class and hopefully be able to show future people what I've worked on.
2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why? My favorite assignment was the first part of the private car service because it was fun working with the google maps api.
3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now? I think I've grown more in this class than others because I actually had to force myself to learn more instead of just relying on what I already know.
4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? The most important thing I learned in this course was how to work as a team better. We've had trouble with figuring out what we've wanted to do for our final project and how we would implement it, and through those two struggles, I've learned a lot of how to voice my own opinion to the team without being overbearing.
5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into? I'd like to learn how to design more fun and interactive web pages because I feel like I really enjoy designing things.
