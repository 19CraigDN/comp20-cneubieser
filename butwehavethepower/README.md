COMP 20 Spring 2019 Private Repo for Craig Neubieser

1. I synced up all the lyrics for the Simpsons song, "Union Strike Folk Song," to its corresponding video,
   so the lyrics are displayed when the lyrics are sung. I also added some basic styling.
   
2. I did not collaborate with anyone.

3. I spent about 2 hours on this assignment.
