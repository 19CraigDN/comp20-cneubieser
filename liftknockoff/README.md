The Private Car Service

1. I created a webpage that uses the JavaScript navigator.geolocation object to retrieve one's latitude and longitude. Then, it makes 
   use of the JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object, sending a request out with a username along with the latitude and longitude. This request
   leads to a response which gives information including a list of vehicles' positions and usernames. The web page displays the location
   of the person using it as a pig with glasses icon on google maps. There will also be other markers such as a weinermobile and other
   vehicles given by the response data. All markers can be clicked on and will display the distance to the user as well as the marker's
   corresponding username. The user's marker if clicked on will display its username along with the distance to the weinermobile and
   closest other vehicle. If the weinermobile does not exist or no other vehicles exist, the user's marker will just indicate that they
   do not exist.
   
2. I did not collaborate with anyone but I did use a variation of some code found at:
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3059044/google-maps-js-api-v3-simple-multiple-marker-example
   This helped me create multiple markers displaying different information for each one.

3. I spent about 6 hours on this assignment
