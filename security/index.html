    Introduction
  </div>
  <div class = "bullets">
    The product I'm working with is the server for a private car service which takes in locations and usernames and stores them together in a database.
    The usernames can either correspond to vehicles or passengers. Then, the data can be taken out of the database through specific passenger username queries or
    just by seeing the entire list of all the vehicles. I've been hired to find some securities and vulnerabilities that lie within this implementation of the
    database as well as find some possible fixes.

    Methodology
  </div>
  <div class = "bullets">
    I started off mostly tried to penetrate the server by sending it weird data at first via POST. Over time, I found certain things that worked that would mess with 
    the client's side and cause problems. I then moved on to see if I could find anything specifically involving the privacy of the data and sure enough I found something there as well.

    Abstract of Findings
  </div>
  <div class = "bullets">
    I found three different security and privacy issues with the implementation. Two of these involved input that I gave to the server via POST and one of them involved
    a query that I gave to the server via GET. The three issues varied in severity, but I believe all of them to be important to fix since they all seem to have relatively
    simple solutions.

    Issues found
  </div>
  <div class = "bullets">
    <ul>
        <li>Issue: No range limit on latitude or longitude</li>
        <li>Location: On the page that the client receives from interpreting the data given by their /rides POST</li>
        <li>Severity: Low</li>
        <li>Description: I inserted latitude and longitude values that were outside the boundaries of the earth, 
            so passengers could possibly get locations that are not on earth as the closest vehicle to them</li>
        <li>Proof of vulnerability: <img src=boundary.png></li>
        <li>Resolution: Determine if input for latitude and longitude falls within a certain range of values and if not, don't allow the input</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Issue: Cross site scripting</li>
        <li>Location: On the page that the client receives from interpreting the data given by their /rides POST</li>
        <li>Severity: High</li>
        <li>Description: I inserted an HTML image tag as a username which means people could also possibly post explicit images as their usernames</li>
        <li>Proof of vulnerability: <img src=xss.png></li>
        <li>Resolution: Determine if input has special characters such as angle brackets and if so, don't allow the input</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Issue: NoSQL injection</li>
        <li>Location: In the /passengers.json query</li>
        <li>Severity: Medium</li>
        <li>Description: I got all the data out from the database by using a query that checked if the username was not equal to 1 which included all of the other usernames.</li>
        <li>Proof of vulnerability: <img src=inject.png></li>
        <li>Resolution: Determine if input only characters that are allowed in usernames and if not, don't allow the input</li>
    </ul>

    Conclusion
  </div>
  <div class = "bullets">
    Ultimately, I'm sure there are many more securities and vulnerabilities with this implementation. However, the ones I found were just the ones that stood out to me the 
    most by giving it a first look. They really just show how important it is to look into the security of your applications because they honestly can be so easily broken.
